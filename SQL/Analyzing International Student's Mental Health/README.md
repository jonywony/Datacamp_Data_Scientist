## Background

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
## Insight

#### Comparison of average PHQ-9 score and length of stay

For PHQ-9 test, in the bar chart we can see that the results is higher when the length of stay between 1-4 and 8-9. We can infered that the stress level is increased when the students still adapting in the first few years and when the students stay for more than 8 years.

#### Comparison of average SCS score and length of stay

For SCS test, the comparison is almost the same for every years but there are surge in the 7-8 years.

#### Comparison of average ASISS score and length of stay

For ASISS test, the result is increased from 70-90 from year 1-5 and decreased afterwards. It can be infered that the usually international sudents feel stressed in the first 5 years and can adapted to the culture afterwards.

## Conclusion and Advice

So, based on the 3 test results, the mental health of international students are big issue especially in the first 5 years when the students still trying to adapt to the culture. My advice for university is that the university can add a program about mental health for international students to prevent the stress factor when studying.
